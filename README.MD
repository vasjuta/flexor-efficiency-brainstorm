## Starting Assumptions

1.Current System:
  - Uses a fine-tuned 7B parameter model
  - Processes one conversation at a time
  - Implements two-step classification: evidence finding followed by validation
  - Uses iterative LLM prompting for reasoning plan execution

2.Available Resources:
  - A ground truth engine capable of generating thousands of responses efficiently
  - Current production engine that can generate millions of training examples
  - Existing test sets and validation data

3.Target Improvements:
  - Efficiency increase of 10-100x
  - Solutions must be evaluated on:
    * Potential throughput gains
    * Cost reduction potential
    * Implementation complexity
    * Performance/accuracy impact

## Methodology

Our approach to identifying efficiency improvements:
1. Consider both obvious technical optimizations and structural changes
2. Evaluate each solution conservatively on all four criteria
3. Focus on solutions that can be implemented incrementally

For each proposed solution, we provide conservative estimates based on industry experience and similar system optimizations. Risk assessments assume proper implementation and testing procedures.

While not proposed as standalone solutions, **batching** and **intelligent caching** are universally applicable optimizations that can augment any primary solution:
- **Batching**:
Batching allows for parallel processing of requests by grouping similar tasks, such as embedding generation or initial evidence finding. While the individualized nature of requests makes full batching impractical, opportunities exist for partial batching of shared computations. This can improve throughput and reduce costs without requiring extensive changes to the architecture.

- **Intelligent Caching**:
Selective caching of reusable computations (e.g., embeddings or responses for common queries) can provide significant performance improvements. While the diverse query space limits its broader applicability, caching specific components of the reasoning process (e.g., intermediate results) can still reduce redundant computations and enhance efficiency.
Both approaches should be viewed as complementary tools that can boost the performance of any primary solution, providing an additional layer of optimization.


## Proposed Solutions

### Technical Optimizations

#### 1. Model Size & Quantization Bundle
Currently, the system uses a 7B parameter model for all classification tasks. This solution involves reducing the size of the current 7B model by using smaller models, quantized versions, or distilled variants specifically optimized for the classification task at hand.

Key aspects:
- Replace the general 7B model with smaller, task-specific models where appropriate
- Apply quantization techniques to reduce model memory footprint with minimal impact on accuracy
- Implement model pruning and optimization techniques
- The ground truth engine allows for careful validation of accuracy preservation

Affected areas:
- Throughput Gain: Smaller models require fewer computational resources, enabling faster inference. Estimation: 5-15x
- Cost Reduction: Reduced computational demands directly translate to lower costs for infrastructure and model inference. Estimation: 20-40%
- Complexity: Moderate, as it involves fine-tuning or training a smaller version of the existing model while maintaining task performance.
- Performance: Potential moderate risk of decreased accuracy if smaller models lose essential representational capacity.


#### 2. Pipeline Step Optimization
The current system uses iterative LLM prompting for reasoning plan execution, with separate steps for evidence finding and validation. This solution focuses on streamlining these steps and reducing the number of LLM calls required. This can be done by simplifying or merging steps in the current pipeline, such as combining evidence finding and validation into a single operation, or rethinking the iterative prompting logic.

Key aspects:
- Redesign prompts to combine multiple reasoning steps
- Optimize the sequence of operations in the reasoning plan
- Reduce redundant validations where possible
- Implement early stopping for clear cases
- The ground truth engine can verify accuracy of streamlined steps

Affected areas:
- Throughput Gain: Fewer steps result in faster processing and reduced overhead. Estimation: 1.5-3x
- Cost Reduction: Less computation directly reduces costs. Estimation: 15-25%
- Complexity: Moderate to high, depending on the nature of changes.
- Performance: Risk of losing granularity in reasoning, which could impact accuracy.

### Structural Changes

#### 1. RAG Architecture
This solution proposes a complete architectural shift to a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach. Separating the search and classification steps by using RAG, where a retrieval mechanism narrows down relevant evidence before applying the classification model. Instead of having the LLM process full conversations, the system would use vector search to find relevant information before invoking the LLM.

Key aspects:
- Convert all conversations to vector embeddings
- Implement efficient vector search
- Design retrieval strategy for context selection
- Optimize prompt engineering for retrieved contexts
- Balance retrieval vs. processing costs

Affected areas:
- Throughput Gain: offloads a significant part of reasoning workload to the retrieval step. Estimation: 10-30x
- Cost Reduction: Reduces the load of expensive classification models. Estimation: 30-50%
- Complexity: High, as it requires integrating search systems like vector databases and retraining models for hybrid use.
- Performance: Retrieval quality dependent. If done right, may actually improve accuracy, as models can focus on smaller, more relevant datasets. However, it possesses a risk too by introducing an additional point of failure.


#### 2. Reasoning Plan Decomposition
This solution involves breaking down the reasoning plan into independent, modular process components while maintaining the same underlying model. Unlike the rejected approach of step-specific model distillation, this solution focuses on restructuring the workflow rather than creating multiple specialized models. The system continues to use the existing LLM but organizes the reasoning steps into discrete, parallel-capable processes.


Key aspects:
- Identify independent reasoning components that can run in parallel
- Design clean interfaces between components while using the same underlying model
- Create specialized handlers and prompts for different reasoning types
- Optimize component sequencing for maximum efficiency
- Maintain the model's holistic understanding while modularizing the process

Affected areas:
- Throughput Gain: Smaller tasks are easier to parallelize and optimize. Estimation: 3-8x
- Cost Reduction: Lightweight substeps reduce computational demand. Estimation: 20-40%
- Complexity: Moderate, as decomposition adds architectural layers but simplifies each step.
- Performance: May enhance accuracy by reducing ambiguity in reasoning.



#### 3. Pre-Generated Evidence Pool
This solution involves pre-computing and storing evidence for common patterns and queries in the dataset, creating a fast-access pool of validated results which the classification model can access for faster inference.

Key aspects:
- Identify common query patterns
- Pre-compute evidence for frequent cases
- Maintain an indexed evidence database
- Implement efficient evidence retrieval
- Regular updates to evidence pool

Affected areas:
- Throughput Gain: Eliminates the need for evidence retrieval at runtime. Estimation: 10-30x
- Cost Reduction: Reduces the operational burden on dynamic retrieval systems. Estimation: 40-60%
- Complexity: High, as it requires managing and updating the pre-generated pool.
- Performance: Risks of missing context in dynamic scenarios.




## Solution Impact Summary

| Solution | Throughput Gain | Cost Reduction | Complexity | Risk/Performance Impact |
|----------|----------------|----------------|------------|----------------------|
| Model Size & Quantization | 5-15x | 20-40% | Moderate | Moderate (potential accuracy loss) |
| Pipeline Step Optimization* | 1.5-3x | 15-25% | Moderate-High | Moderate (reasoning granularity loss) |
| RAG Architecture | 10-30x | 30-50% | High | Moderate (retrieval quality dependent) |
| Reasoning Plan Decomposition* | 3-8x | 20-40% | Moderate | Low (may enhance accuracy) |
| Pre-Generated Evidence Pool | 10-30x | 40-60% | High | High (context loss in dynamic scenarios) |

*Pipeline Step Optimization and Reasoning Plan Decomposition represent contrasting approaches to reducing LLM calls: the former aims to combine multiple reasoning steps into fewer, more comprehensive LLM prompts, while the latter breaks down the process into independent components, potentially bypassing LLM usage for simpler steps. Despite their opposing philosophies, both target the same goal of reduced computational load, approaching it from different directions - consolidation versus decomposition.

*Note: All estimates are conservative and assume proper implementation and testing procedures.*

# Deep Dive: RAG Architecture Solution
After evaluating multiple options above, we identified Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) as a particularly promising approach. Its ability to drastically reduce the LLM’s workload by separating evidence retrieval from classification aligns directly with our goals of improving efficiency and scalability. By focusing the LLM’s reasoning on a smaller, highly relevant subset of data, RAG offers the potential for significant throughput gains, cost savings, and even improved accuracy.

In the following section, we will delve deeper into the RAG architecture, breaking it down into design considerations, implementation details, and a detailed evaluation of its impact. This will provide a practical roadmap for integrating RAG into Flexor’s system.

## Example Query Processing

Let's walk through how the system would handle the example query: "Was there a complaint by the customer that due to a bug in Appsflyer services they are losing money?"

### Step 1: Query Processing
```python
# Initial query embedding and retrieval
query = "Was there a complaint by the customer that due to a bug in Appsflyer services they are losing money?"

# Retrieval Engine processes the query
retrieved_chunks = retrieval_engine.process_query(
    query,
    context_size=5  # Get top 5 relevant chunks
)

# Example of retrieved chunks might look like:
# 1. "Customer reported significant revenue loss due to SDK malfunction..."
# 2. "The tracking bug in latest version is causing us to lose ad spend..."
# 3. "Technical issue with conversion tracking impacting ROI..."
```

### Step 2: Classification
```python
# Classification prompt template
TEMPLATE = """
Based on the following context and query, determine if there's a valid customer complaint about financial loss due to an AppsFlyer bug.

Query: {query}

Relevant Context:
{context}

Reasoning steps:
1. Is there a complaint about financial loss?
2. Is it attributed to an AppsFlyer bug?
3. Is it from a customer?
4. Is the financial impact explicitly stated?

Please analyze each step and provide a final yes/no determination.
"""

# Classification Engine processes with context
result = classification_engine.classify(query, retrieved_chunks)

# Example result structure
{
    'has_valid_complaint': True,
    'evidence': {
        'financial_loss_mentioned': True,
        'bug_attribution': True,
        'customer_source': True,
        'explicit_impact': True
    },
    'confidence': 0.92,
    'supporting_chunks': ['chunk_id_1', 'chunk_id_3']
}
```

## Leveraging Available Engines

Our RAG architecture implementation can be significantly enhanced by utilizing the two provided engines effectively:

### Ground Truth Engine Utilization
This engine can generate thousands of responses efficiently and serves as our accuracy benchmark.

**Quality Assurance Pipeline**
```python
class QualityAssurance:
    def __init__(self, ground_truth_engine, rag_system):
        self.ground_truth = ground_truth_engine
        self.rag = rag_system
    
    async def validate_batch(self, test_queries: List[str]) -> Dict:
        results = {
            'accuracy': [],
            'retrieval_quality': [],
            'latency_comparison': []
        }
        
        for query in test_queries:
            # Get ground truth
            truth = await self.ground_truth.get_answer(query)
            
            # Get RAG result
            rag_result = await self.rag.process_request(query)
            
            # Compare and collect metrics
            results['accuracy'].append(
                self._compare_results(truth, rag_result)
            )
            results['retrieval_quality'].append(
                self._assess_retrieval(truth, rag_result.context)
            )
            
        return self._aggregate_metrics(results)
```

### Current Engine Utilization
This engine can generate millions of examples, perfect for training and optimization.

1.**Training Data Generation**

class TrainingDataGenerator:
    def __init__(self, current_engine):
        self.engine = current_engine
    
    async def generate_embedding_training_data(
        self,
        sample_size: int = 1_000_000
    ) -> Dict:
        # Generate diverse set of queries and responses
        queries = await self._generate_diverse_queries(sample_size)
        
        # Process through current engine
        training_data = []
        for query in queries:
            response = await self.engine.process(query)
            training_data.append({
                'query': query,
                'response': response,
                'context': self._extract_relevant_context(response)
            })
        
        return self._prepare_for_embedding_training(training_data)
```

2.**Pattern Analysis and Optimization**
```python
class PatternAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self, current_engine):
        self.engine = current_engine
    
    async def analyze_query_patterns(
        self,
        sample_size: int = 1_000_000
    ) -> Dict:
        # Generate and process large sample
        samples = await self._generate_samples(sample_size)
        
        patterns = {
            'common_structures': self._extract_patterns(samples),
            'edge_cases': self._identify_edge_cases(samples),
            'complexity_distribution': self._analyze_complexity(samples)
        }

```

## Detailed Impact Analysis

### Throughput Gain (10-30x)
Detailed breakdown:
- **Vector Search**: ~100μs per query vs several seconds for full LLM processing
- **Reduced Context Window**: 70-90% reduction in tokens processed by LLM
- **Single-Pass Classification**: Eliminates multiple LLM calls for reasoning steps

Factors affecting gain:
- Vector store performance at scale
- Quality of embeddings and retrieval
- Chunk size optimization

**Throughput Gain Approximation** 
Current System:
- Each input conversation contains ~1000 tokens.  
- The LLM processes these tokens in 1 second per query.  

RAG System:  
- Retrieval narrows down the context to 100 tokens (top-k results).  
- The same LLM takes ~0.1 seconds to process this reduced input.  

**Estimated Gain**: 10x (for k=100 tokens). This scales with higher conversation sizes or reduced context windows.  


### **Cost Reduction (30-50%)**

Detailed breakdown:

**1. Computation Costs**
- **Token Reduction**: 80-90% fewer tokens processed by the LLM due to reduced context size from retrieval.
- **Embedding Computation Cost**: Precomputing embeddings for the dataset, amortized over multiple queries.
- **Vector Search Infrastructure Cost**: Cost for operating and querying the vector database.

**2. Storage Costs**
- **Embedding Storage**: Additional storage required for embeddings, proportional to dataset size.
- **Index Maintenance Overhead**: Cost of keeping the vector database optimized for retrieval.
- **Backup and Redundancy**: Ensuring reliability and fault tolerance for the embedding store.

**Cost Reduction Approximation**

Current System:
- Total Tokens Processed: `1M queries * 1000 tokens/query = 1B tokens`.
- Cost: `1B tokens * $0.001/token = $1000`.

RAG System:
1.Token Processing:
   - Tokens processed by the LLM: `1M queries * 100 tokens/query = 100M tokens`.
   - Cost: `100M tokens * $0.001/token = $100`.

2.Embedding Computation and Storage:
   - One-time Embedding Computation: Assume `1M queries * $0.001/embedding = $1000`.
   - Storage Costs**: Embedding storage for `1M documents (at 1KB each) = 1GB`:
   - Monthly storage cost: `1GB * $0.02/GB/month = $0.02/month`.

3.Vector Search Infrastructure:
   - Assume infrastructure costs `$0.10/query * 1M queries = $100`.

**Total Cost for RAG System:**
- **Per-query Costs:** `$100 (tokens) + $100 (search) = $200`.
- **Amortized Embedding Costs:** Assuming embeddings last 10M queries, the cost per 1M queries: `$1000/10M queries = $100/1M queries`.
- **Total Cost:** `$200 + $100 = $300`.

**Cost Savings:**
- **Current System Cost:** `$1000`.
- **RAG System Cost:** `$300`.
- **Net Savings:** `70%`.
