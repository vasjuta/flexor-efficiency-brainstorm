# Flexor Efficiency Improvement Proposal - Executive Summary

## Context & Goals
- Current: 7B model with iterative processing, two-step classification
- Target: 10-100x efficiency improvement
- Available: Ground truth engine (1000s responses) and production engine (millions of examples)

## Solution Overview
We evaluated multiple efficiency improvement approaches, focusing on both technical optimizations and structural changes.

## Key Solutions Evaluated

### Technical Optimizations
1.**Model Size & Quantization** (5-15x gain, 20-40% cost reduction)
  - Smaller models, quantization techniques
  - Moderate complexity, moderate risk

2.**Pipeline Step Optimization** (1.5-3x gain, 15-25% cost reduction)
  - Streamlined reasoning steps
  - Moderate complexity, moderate risk

### Structural Changes
1.**RAG Architecture** (10-30x gain, 30-50% cost reduction)
  - Vector search + focused LLM processing
  - High complexity, moderate risk

2.**Reasoning Plan Decomposition** (3-8x gain, 20-40% cost reduction)
  - Modular process components
  - Moderate complexity, low risk

3.**Pre-Generated Evidence Pool** (10-30x gain, 40-60% cost reduction)
  - Pre-computed results for common patterns
  - High complexity, high risk

## Recommended Approach: RAG Architecture
Selected for detailed implementation due to:
- Significant efficiency gains (10-30x)
- Substantial cost reduction (30-50%)
- Proven architecture pattern
- Leverages existing engines effectively

### Implementation Highlights
- Vector store for efficient retrieval
- Reduced context window (70-90% token reduction)
- Single-pass classification
- Extensive use of ground truth engine for validation
- Current engine utilized for training data generation

### Cost Analysis Example
- Current: $1000 per 1M queries
- RAG System: $300 per 1M queries
- Net savings: 70%

### Risk Mitigation
- Regular embedding updates
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Monitoring system for retrieval quality
- Fallback mechanisms for edge cases
